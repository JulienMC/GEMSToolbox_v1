Dear reviewers,

You can find all the necessary information to run our code in the README.md file.

Please note however that due to licensing restrictions we are unable to share the
results from the case study other than as images in the paper.

We can offer you two options:
   1 - Secure the data to test the model using the instructions below.
   2 - We built a simple grid as part of the DefaultScenario.csv which should
   allow you to run the code, test it, and view the results. In fact those results
     are already available in the results folder for you to look at. Simply open the
     DefaultScenario_Demo_2_00001.vtk in ParaView.

If you wish to access the digitised maps from the case study data you can request
a free academic licence from the Coal Authority at permissions@coal.gov.uk.

Once you have received your licence the Coal Authority will need to contact us to
release the data to yourselves. To preserve your right to anonymity please request
for your name not to be shared with us. Tell the Coal Authority you are reviewing
the paper "GEMSToolbox: A Novel Modelling Tool for Rapid
Screening of Mines for Geothermal Heat Extraction" by Julien Mouli-Castillo,
Jeroen van-Hunen, Michael MacKenzie, Tom Sear, Charlotte Adams. Ask them to let us
know that Reviewer X has secured a license to obtain the digitised map files
and we will liaise with the editor to get the files to you.

We hope you will find the paper and the code interesting.

Best wishes,

The Authors.
